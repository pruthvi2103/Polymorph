## What is Polymorph?

Polymorph is a client-side image conversion tool which converts your images to and from formats like JPEG,PNG,BMP and GIF.
Its a Progressive Web Application meaning that the images you convert are never uploaded to a server so you do not need an active internet connection

## Features

-   Convert images to different formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF
-   Customize image dimensions
-   Easy-to-use interface
-   Batch Jobs

## Sate of the App before Hackathon

Did not exist and no popular open source fully offline apps for image converstion especially for bulk images, makes lives of designers and frontend devs easier who aim at making lightweight and fast apps
